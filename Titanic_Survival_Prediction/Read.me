Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Random Forest Model

This is a machine learning project where I built a Random Forest model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle.

Objective

Predict which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

Dataset

Kaggle Titanic Competition: [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

Techniques Used

- Feature engineering (Title extraction from names)
- Median imputation of missing Age values based on `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Title`
- Label encoding of categorical variables
- Model training using RandomForestClassifier from `sklearn`
- Validation split and accuracy calculation

Results

- Achieved ~81% validation accuracy on unseen data using Random Forest.
- Efficient handling of missing data and irrelevant columns.

Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

Future Improvements

- Add more advanced ensemble methods like XGBoost or VotingClassifier
- Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Add visualizations for feature importance
